## Write a short comment describing this function
## 
## this function creates a Matrix like object that can cache
## its inverse (when that inverse is computed by cacheSolve, below, 
## that knows how to calculate and store values in the cache
## or look them up in the cache, as appropriate)
## 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
